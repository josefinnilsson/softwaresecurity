This is an error trace of a faulty property. The model fails to satisfy the property
AG (outer_door.status = open -> !(airlock.state = clean)) 
The property states that always when the outer door is open, the airlock state should be dirty.

According the description of the airlock, always when the outer door is open,
the state of the airlock should be clean.

We have thus faulty property, it should be 
AG (outer_door.status = open -> (airlock.state = clean))
instead.



-- specification AG (outer_door.status = open -> !(airlock.state = clean))  is false
