All tasks described in the lab PM were attempted. The tasks are split into files as follows:

- Base features (2.0-2.4), advanced properties (3.1) and automated cleaning (3.2) are in biolab0.smv
- Evacuation mode (3.3) is in biolabEvac.smv
- Lockdown mode (3.4) is in biolabLockdown.smv
- Documented error trace of faulty model (3.5.1) is in error_trace.txt
- Documented error trace of faulty property (3.5.2) is in error_trace_property.txt
- Documented simulation trace of correct model of airlock with lockdown mode (3.5.3) is in simulation.txt
