-- For simplicity, the input of both buttons is merged.
-- The airlock also has two states:
--   clean: no hazardous materials in the airlock; prerequisite for the
--   outer door to open
--   dirty: after the inner door has opened
-- After the hazmat suit of a person coming from inside has been disposed
-- of, and the air has been cleaned, a dirty airlock is clean again.
-- Flag "cleaning" indicates if the airlock itself is being cleaned,
-- so a "dirty" airlock can again be clean again in the next state.
